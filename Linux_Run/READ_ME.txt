All you have to do is run the bash script (run.sh)
To do that, do the following:

1.Type: ./run.sh

FYI I did not submit the data files as we were supposed to. If you need them, just put the following files in the the "Data_Files" folder:
1. data.eval.anon
2. data.eval.id
3. data.test
4. data.test.id
5. data.train
6. data.train.id
7. tweets.txt
